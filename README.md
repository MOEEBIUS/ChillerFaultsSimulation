# ChillerFaultsSimulation

The models defined allow the simulation of a chiller system, as well as the 
simulation of selected chiller faults. The Chiller model consists of 
the following components: compressor, evaporator,  condenser, one liquid container, 
a valve, sensors and controllers.


## Fault-free Operation (FaultFreeOperation.mo)

This model allows the user to simulate the Fault Free Operation of a Chiller. 



## Reduced Condenser Water Flow Fault (ReducedCondFlow.mo)


## Reduced Evaporator Water Flow Fault (ReducedEvapFlow.mo)


## Cooling Tower Malfunction Fault (CoolingTowerMalfunction.mo)


## AHU Fan Malfunction Fault (AHUFanMalfunction.mo)


## Dependencies

This model is based on ThermoCycle Library (http://www.thermocycle.net/) and 
ExternalMedia Library (https://github.com/modelica/ExternalMedia) components. 


## Licence

This model is released by Technische Hochschule Nuernberg Georg Simon Ohm under the Modelica License 2.0.
